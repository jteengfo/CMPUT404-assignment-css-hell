# Part 1

Listed below, are the some of the attributes I added/modified for three gutenberg documents.

1. Body background color
    - I changed the bg color to #eae4d3 to give it more of a vintage, earthy tone. The color also still has a good contrast to a default black font color which will make it easier for users to read the text while not being too bright (like a default #FFFFF) which may irritate user's sight for prolonged times of reading. 

2. H1 Heading 
    - I changed the font style to Merriweather and increased the font size from 200 to 500%. The reason I chose merriweather is because it is the top 1 serif font used in 2022 according to this article (https://wplook.com/serif-fonts/). 
    - I increased the font size because it is a title and I personally thought it required more size. 

3. H2 Heading
    - I changed the font style to Oswald. The reason I used this font style is becasue according to the same article linked above, https://wplook.com/serif-fonts/, Oswald is one of the most popular font style pairs with Merriweather. 
    - I changed the font color from a default black to #403d39 to create distinction between millions of texts in the page. It is a subtle change that may help users separate blocks of text according to their semantics. 

4. H3 Heading
    - I changed the font style to Robot Slab because it also is one of the most popular font style pairings with Merriweather.

5. Paragraph
    - I increased the font size to 16pt. Although users can now adjust the font size of the texts through different reader formats built in different browsers, I still think the default font size was too small. Hence, I decided to increase it to 16pt. 

6. Image (cover)
    - I changed the max-width of the image to 100% and height to auto. This is to dynamically change the size of the photo as users resize the browser.
