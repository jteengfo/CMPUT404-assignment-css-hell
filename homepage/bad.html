                I am currently a 4th year university student at the University of Alberta located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. 
                I am majoring in Computing Science and minoring in Statistics.
                My current interests lies within UI/UX Design but with my minor being in Statistics, I am also interested in Data Science as well. 
                With the opportunity of being in the program of Computing Science offered by the university, 
                I would like to delve onto different concentrations/fields it has to offer such as software/web development, machine learning, 
                data science and UI/UX.

                            is a course about web applications and architecture taught at the University of Alberta. As part of the course, we are currently
                            in the process of creating a social media distribution using Django as our web framework as a team of five students. We are also using
                            React to create the UI interface. More details linked in the Github repository linked above.
